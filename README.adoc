Carefully crafted settings for alien's editor I become used to.

== My themes

=== Light theme
.habamax-theme -- work in progress
image::img_README_1.png[]


=== Dark theme
.kosmos-theme -- in melpa
image::img_README_2.png[]


== Gotchas and Goodies

=== Windows cmd.exe shell encoding

Windows cmd shell encoding problems -- can't search russian text using
`ripgrep/grep/pt/ack` or (shell-command "program.exe русский_файл.txt")

[source,lisp]
----
(defun windows? ()
  "return true if Windows"
  (eq system-type 'windows-nt))

;; This is windows only
;; I have finally solved the problem of external processes to use Russian language,
;; Now rg.exe can actually search Russian words from Emacs.
(when (windows?)
  (setq default-process-coding-system '(utf-8-dos . cp1251-dos)))

----

=== Follow mode

It is awesome for writing long documents -- just vertically split a window and
turn on `follow-mode` to have continuation of the buffer in the second splitted
window.


=== Change or Remove minibuffer text on startup

Define a function with the text you need:

[source,elisp]
----
;; show emacs startup time
(defun display-startup-echo-area-message ()
  (let ((elapsed (float-time (time-subtract (current-time)
                                            emacs-start-time)))) ; <1>
    (message "Loading Emacs configuration... DONE (%.3fs),  overral emacs-init-time: %s" elapsed (emacs-init-time))))

----

<1> is defined earlier as `(defconst emacs-start-time (current-time))`
